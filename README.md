Visualizing international soccer clubs and stadiums using CesiumJS

To Do List:
 - Set up github demo page for showing off...
 - Fix Japanese and German Stadium coordinates (stupid Google Maps!)
 - Add more leagues (Off top of head, Portuguese, Scottish, Russian...hell, all of Champions League...Korean, various South American, Egyptian)
 - Fix initial camera position (currently defaults to the centroid of all the points, which makes it random)
 - Add instructions for use
